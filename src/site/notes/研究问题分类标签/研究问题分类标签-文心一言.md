|**核心领域**|资产定价, 机器学习|“Empirical Asset Pricing via Machine Learning”|
|**研究问题**|风险溢价测量, 模型比较, 预测性能分析|“We perform a comparative analysis of machine learning methods for the canonical problem of empirical asset pricing: measuring asset risk premiums.”, “Our primary contributions are twofold.<br><br>![b02616809ae334458254ccd074bcdce4_MD5.png](/img/user/b02616809ae334458254ccd074bcdce4_MD5.png)<br><br> First, we provide a new set of benchmarks for the predictive accuracy of machine learning methods in measuring risk premiums of the aggregate market and individual stocks.”, “We study a set of candidate models that are potentially well suited to address the three empirical challenges outlined above.”|
|**方法类型**|实证分析, 对比研究|“We conduct a large-scale empirical analysis, investigating nearly 30,000 individual stocks over 60 years from 1957 to 2016.”, “We perform a comparative analysis of machine learning methods”|
|**创新点**|引入机器学习方法改进风险溢价测量，比较多种机器学习模型在资产定价中的应用效果|“Our work extends the empirical literature on stock return prediction, which comes in two basic strands. The first strand models differences in expected returns across stocks as a function of stock-level characteristics, and is exemplified by Fama and French (2008) and Lewellen (2015). The typical approach in this literature runs cross-sectional regressions of future stock returns on a few lagged stock characteristics. The second strand forecasts the time series of returns and is surveyed by Welch and Goyal (2008), Koijen and Nieuwerburgh (2011), and Rapach and Zhou (2013). This literature typically conducts time-series regressions of broad aggregate portfolio returns on a small number of macroeconomic predictor variables. Our primary contribution is to demonstrate potent return predictability that is harnessable from the large collection of existing variables when machine learning methods are used.”|
|**关注资产**|美国股市个股, 标准普尔500指数及其成分股|“We obtain monthly total individual equity returns from CRSP for all firms listed in the NYSE, AMEX, and NASDAQ. Our sample begins in March 1957 (the start date of the S&P 500) and ends in December 2016, totaling 60 years.”|
|**时间区间**|1957年3月至2016年12月|“Our sample begins in March 1957 (the start date of the S&P 500) and ends in December 2016, totaling 60 years.”|
|**数据频率**|月度数据|“We obtain monthly total individual equity returns from CRSP for all firms listed in the NYSE, AMEX, and NASDAQ.”|
|**国家**|美国|“We obtain monthly total individual equity returns from CRSP for all firms listed in the NYSE, AMEX, and NASDAQ.”（CRSP为美国证券价格研究中心）|
|**模型评价指标**|样本外R², 夏普比率|“To assess predictive performance for individual excess stock return forecasts, we calculate the out-of-sample R²”, “We assess the economic magnitudes of portfolio predictability. Campbell and Thompson (2008) show that small improvements in R² can map into large utility gains for a mean-variance investor. They show that the Sharpe ratio (SR*) earned by an active investor exploiting predictive information (summarized as a predictive R²) improves over the Sharpe ratio (SR) earned by a buy-and-hold investor according to SR'=√((SR^2+R^2)/(1-R^2))”|
|**主要结论**|1. 机器学习方法显著提高了风险溢价的预测能力。 2. 神经网络和回归树在预测准确性上表现最佳。 3. 浅层学习优于深层学习。 4. 关键预测信号包括动量、流动性和波动性。|“Our findings demonstrate that machine learning methods can help improve our empirical understanding of asset prices. Neural networks and, to a lesser extent, regression trees, are the best performing methods. We track down the source of their predictive advantage to accommodation of nonlinear interactions that are missed by other methods. We also find that 'shallow' learning outperforms 'deep' learning, which differs from the typical conclusion in other fields, such as computer vision or bioinformatics, and is likely due to the comparative dearth of data and low signal-to-noise ratio in asset pricing problems. Machine learning methods are most valuable for forecasting larger and more liquid stock returns and portfolios. Lastly, we find that all methods agree on a fairly small set of dominant predictive signals, the most powerful predictors being associated with price trends including return reversal and momentum. The next most powerful predictors are measures of stock liquidity, stock volatility, and valuation ratios.”|
|**后续研究方向**|结合机器学习与均衡资产定价模型，探索更深层次的经济机制|“A nascent literature is marrying machine learning to equilibrium asset pricing (e.g., Kelly, Pruitt, and Su 2019; Gu, Kelly, and Xiu 2019; Feng, Giglio, and Xiu forthcoming), and this remains an exciting direction for future research.”|
